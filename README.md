# Student project by Antonia Entorf & Marc Lipfert

Our project aims at replicating the main results of the following article:

González , L. (2013): The Effect of a Universal Child Benefit on Conceptions, Abortions, and Early Maternal Labor Supply. American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 5(3): 160–188. [(link to the paper)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.5.3.160)


To Do:
- replicating main results and plots
- small improvements/corrections compared to the author's data analysis:
  - calculating month of conception with more accuracy (this will affect about 2% of observations)
  - drop observations with missing value equal to 0 (about 10% of obs)
  - correct minor mistakes in generating calendar month of birth variable which is used for robustness checks
- there should be a heterogenous treatment effect among rather rich and poor families --> we aim at estimating two different effects to       gain more precise information about the treatment effect
